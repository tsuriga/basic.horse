# Trojan Defense 2D
Once upon a time there was a unfinished game called Trojan Defense (which is still in developement).
It was/is a 3D FPS. This project is about making a 2D version of it with HTML5/Javascript and some other random libraries.

Todo:
- GUI
- Character movement (keys to move, mouse to aim)
- Level generation / Wall placement
- Pathfinding + Trojan AI
- Inserting obstacles
- Player class to handle player attributes (HP, items, ammoes,..)
- Changing weapon functions
- Spawning trojans (enemies)
- Inventory / Powerup system
- Excellent particle effects and bulletholes
- Darkness behind corners
- Sound effects & Music
